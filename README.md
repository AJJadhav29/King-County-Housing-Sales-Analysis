# 🏡 King County Housing Sales Analysis (Excel)

## 📌 What I Did

- Analyzed housing data in Excel using descriptive statistics and regression models
- Explored price and size variability (sqft_living, lot, above, basement)
- Built multiple linear regression models using Excel’s Data Analysis Toolpak
- Iteratively refined models by removing insignificant variables (based on p-values)
- Achieved final model with **R² = 0.6548**, identifying key price predictors like:
  - bathrooms, sqft_living, floors, waterfront, view, condition, grade, and renovations
- Conducted hypothesis tests:
  - ✅ Waterfront homes are significantly more expensive
  - ✅ Older homes have significantly lower prices
